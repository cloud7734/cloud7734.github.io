        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jake Nugent and I'm a programmer. I started my career in the late 2000's as the "computer guy" for a Building Automation company. Coming from a programming and computer repair background, I had exactly what the company needed for the direction they were going.</p>
        <p>I have built a fantastic career path in 14 years, moving from hands-on programming and troubleshooting to system design and drafting to (presently) regional engineering leadership. Programming is where my passion REALLY lies and I am working toward reinvigorating those brain cells through online professional certification courses. My overall work experience has granted me many many soft skills and I have found every excuse possible during my career to automate repetitive or complex tasks through Excel functions, Visio and Visual Basic programming, C#, and more. Programming is my dream job. I look forward to working with YOU to realize my dreams and help you reach yours!</p>
